X-SPELLS - eXplaining Sentiment Prediction by generating ExempLars in the Latent Space

Explaining Sentiment Classification with Synthetic Exemplars and Counter-Exemplars

The recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in the use of machine learning models in a wide range of application fields, including businesses, self-driving cars, medicine, public policy, and many others. A large part of those machine learning models are black boxes, i.e., their overall functioning and the logic behind their decisions for a given input instance are not clearly understandable to humans. We present X-SPELLS, a model-agnostic local approach for explaining the decisions of a black box model for sentiment classification of short texts. The explanations provided consist of a set of exemplar sentences and a set of counter-exemplar sentences. The former are examples classified by the black box with the same label as the text to explain. The latter are examples classified with a different label (a form of counterfactuals). Both are close in meaning to the text to explain, and both are meaningful sentences { albeit they are synthetically generated. xspells generates neighbours of the text to explain in a latent space using Variational Autoencoders for encoding text and decoding latent instances. A decision tree is learned from randomly generated neighbours, and used to drive the selection of the exemplars and counter-exemplars.
